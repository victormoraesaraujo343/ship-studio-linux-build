## Unreleased

- **A plugin can take over the workspace** - Plugins are no longer confined to a toolbar button or a dropdown: one can now own a tab of its own beside Code and Branches, with the whole right pane under it. Selecting it hides the preview, and the tab falls back to Preview if you disable the plugin while it is open.


## What's New in v0.18.7 (Linux)

- **GitLab, not just GitHub** - Branches, pushes and merge requests follow the forge your project actually uses, instead of assuming GitHub and a remote called `origin`. GitLab sign-in is driven through `glab` the same way GitHub is through `gh`.
- **Nothing is reported back** - Analytics and error reporting ship off by default in this fork.
- **A bug that could log you out** - A stop signal aimed at process 0 reached the whole login session instead of the intended child, ending a desktop session outright. It can't happen now.
- **Branch switching that takes the flag it needs** - Switching uses `git switch`, which accepts an option `git checkout` silently never did.
- **Linux onboarding** - Setup drives your distribution's own package manager, and the terminal spawns your real login shell — fish included — rather than a hard-coded one.


## What's New in v0.18.6

- **Two crash fixes** - No more panic on commit messages with accents/emoji/non-Latin text; closing a project can no longer crash via the dev-server logs terminal
- **Plugins heal themselves and work on Windows** - Broken installs auto-reinstall from source, the plugin manager checks for updates, and all bundled plugins (GA, Cloudflare, Sanity, Figma, Brand Guidelines, Webflow to Code) now run on Windows
- **More reliable PRs and pushes** - PR pushes use your GitHub sign-in, transient GitHub server errors and 100MB-file rejections are no longer mistaken for push races
- **Friendlier errors everywhere** - pnpm build-approval prompts, corporate-proxy TLS, Homebrew failures, locked configs, enterprise-policy MCP blocks, out-of-memory git, and localized git output all explain themselves now
- **78 auto-reported issues fixed since 0.18.5**


## What's New in v0.18.5

- **Native macOS thumbnails** - Project thumbnails are captured instantly from the app's own preview instead of a background Chrome — eliminating the thumbnail failure family (profile locks, crashes, leftover processes) behind most error reports.
- **Visual editor edits can't be silently lost** - If the source file changed mid-edit (formatter, hot reload), your text is re-applied to the right place — or you're told plainly.
- **Timed-out commands are truly stopped** - git, gh, deploys and screenshots no longer linger invisibly after a timeout, holding locks and wasting resources.
- **PR descriptions work on big diffs** - Prompt via stdin (no more "argument list too long") and a real time budget for large diffs.
- **Windows fixes** - npm/npx launch correctly from health checks and dev tooling; JPEG custom thumbnails accepted.
- **80+ auto-reported issues fixed** - Clearer, calmer errors across git, GitHub, plugins, onboarding, and the visual editor — the largest cleanup release yet.


## What's New in v0.18.4

- **App freeze fixed** - Running multiple projects could freeze the whole app until force-quit: background thumbnail captures piled up silently and starved it. Captures are now strictly time-limited and never overlap.
- **Thumbnails reliable again** - An interrupted capture no longer leaves a lock file that broke every future capture (the most-reported bug of v0.18.3), and captures survive your browser being open.
- **Commits no longer blocked by .shipstudio** - Ship Studio's metadata folder is always excluded from your commits, so a background process holding a file there can't fail a commit or publish (frequent on Windows).
- **Real errors when a command can't start** - A missing package manager or tool is now named with install guidance, instead of a bare "exited with code -1".
- **Draft PRs handled** - A Draft badge with merging disabled, instead of a raw GraphQL error.
- **Steadier hot reload** - The preview retries a dropped WebSocket connection to your dev server instead of giving up on the first hiccup.
- **60+ more auto-reported fixes** - Across four bug-bash rounds: clearer errors for expired GitHub sign-ins, network blips, Homebrew permissions, abandoned merges, and Windows tool resolution for IDEs, health checks, and plugins.


## What's New in v0.18.3

- **Safety fix: your home folder can never be treated as a project** - A stray .git or .gitignore in your home directory could let "Discard Changes" run git cleanup across personal files. Now refused at every layer, including for already-registered entries.

**New Eve Agent template** - Build an AI agent on Vercel's Eve framework with a web chat UI, under Other in the create-project picker.

**"Window → New Window" windows fully work again** - Update checks, terminal fonts, and live events were silently broken by a missing permission grant.

**Clearer GitHub errors** - Expired sign-ins and missing write access now say so (with a reconnect hint) instead of dumping raw git output.

**Windows fixes** - Thumbnails no longer fail while your browser is open; plugin installs ride out antivirus file locks.

**20+ more auto-reported fixes** - Real npm errors on failed installs, screenshot readiness checks, accurate onboarding error messages, static sites served from public/, filenames containing "..", embedded plugin windows no longer clipped, and a sweep of "[object Object]" diagnostics.


## What's New in v0.18.2

- **11 more auto-reported bugs fixed** - The automatic error reporting pipeline caught and we fixed another 11 bugs within hours of detection
- **Agent installs work on slow connections** - The setup terminal no longer kills a quiet-but-healthy download and loops forever; downloads now show live progress
- **Git works reliably on Windows** - All git operations resolve the git binary up front, fixing bare "program not found" failures; missing tools are now named
- **Edit repeated elements** - The markup editor offers edit-all/just-one for elements that appear in several identical places, matching the class editor
- **MCP registration hardened** - Broken agent installs are skipped, registration no longer races itself, and remove is idempotent across CLI wording variants
- **Plugin safety** - Shell timeouts are capped at 10 minutes and timed-out commands are actually killed; stale plugin calls after uninstall/project switch are silent
- **Quieter error telemetry** - Routine states (missing tools, validation feedback, security guardrails) are no longer reported as bugs


## What's New in v0.18.1

- **Bug bash** - 40+ auto-reported bugs fixed within two days of v0.18.0, thanks to the new automatic error reporting
- **Clean shutdown** - quitting Ship Studio now stops all dev servers and agent sessions; restarting a dev server reliably frees its port
- **Preview resilience** - wedged dev servers (404 on every page) are detected with a one-click restart, and hot reload survives dev-server restarts
- **Agent spawning** - terminals find your agent wherever it's installed (nvm, pnpm, volta, fnm), fixing "Unable to spawn claude" on valid installs
- **Windows fixes** - GitHub CLI in its default install path works for fetch/pull/merge, project deletion waits out antivirus locks, consistent path handling
- **Publishing hardening** - sparse-checkout repos commit again, failed saves can't silently slip past a publish, conflicted PR merges open the resolver
- **Plugin docs** - new guide for building your own plugins (docs/plugins.md)


## What's New in v0.18.0

- **Automatic bug reports** - When something goes wrong, Ship Studio now reports the error automatically (fully anonymized — never your code or file contents) so bugs get found and fixed faster. Opt out anytime in Settings → Usage analytics & error reports.


## What's New in v0.17.2

- **Fresh Slack invites** - All Slack links in the app now go through ship.studio/slack, so the community invite always stays fresh — even in older app versions


## What's New in v0.17.1

- **Fixed worktree sidebar duplication** - Projects no longer show duplicate rows in the sidebar when worktrees are open. Grouping now asks git which repository a worktree belongs to, so it works for imported projects living outside ~/ShipStudio too. Creating a worktree while working inside another worktree now files it under the project itself.


## What's New in v0.17.0

- **Worktrees** - Work on multiple branches of the same project at the same time. Each worktree opens as its own workspace — its own agent, terminal, dev server, and preview — switchable from the sidebar with everything staying hot. Real git underneath, so your terminal and the app always agree.


## What's New in v0.16.0

- **Structural editing in the visual editor** - Insert, duplicate, and delete elements right on the canvas, committed straight to source (community feature by Benoît)
- **Shared libraries** - Attach folders of skills and reference docs your agent brings into every project in the workspace (community feature by Sam)
- **A clearer git workflow** - Redesigned Branches tab: sync badges, base-branch selection, friendly git errors, and an on-demand branch graph (community feature by Adam)
- **Dedicated dev-server ports** - Every project gets its own port; no more collisions on 3000 or cross-project thumbnails
- **Dashboard list view** - Switch to a list layout and act on multiple projects in bulk (community feature by Ben)
- **AI generation with Codex** - PR titles/descriptions and commit messages now generate with Codex as your default agent
- **Windows improvements** - Robust project deletion and plugin installs, terminal spawn fix, and agent-led onboarding by default (community fixes by Vasanth)


## What's New in v0.15.0

- **Your agent can now use the preview** - Claude Code (and Codex, Opencode, Cursor) get built-in tools to see and drive your live preview: screenshots, console errors, network requests, clicking, typing, page and breakpoint switching — so the agent verifies its own changes. A green glow and cursor show exactly what it's doing. Zero setup on every project you open.
- **Agent-led onboarding** - Pick your AI agent and it installs everything for you (Homebrew, Node, Git, GitHub, your hosting CLI) while Ship Studio verifies each step with its own checks. Classic onboarding stays one click away.
- **Set an exact preview size** - Click the dimensions readout in the preview toolbar to type a width and height; oversized viewports render at true width and scale to fit.
- **Screenshot reliability** - Screenshots self-heal when macOS evicts the headless browser, and a Playwright/Node 24 install hang is fixed.


## What's New in v0.14.0

- **Push and Pull, the way git means it** - The header button now always says **Push** — no more guessing whether "Publish", "Sync", or "Go Live" will do the thing. And there's a new **Pull** button beside the branch name: one click grabs the latest from GitHub. If a pull hits merge conflicts you get the visual resolver — with a new **Send to Agent** button that hands the whole merge to your agent. A pull can never overwrite unsaved work; git stops safely and the app tells you exactly what to do.
- **The visual CSS editor now works on Next.js projects with plain CSS** - Point-and-click editing of your global stylesheets on Next.js, not just Astro/HTML. CSS Modules are detected and explained rather than mis-edited.
- **New "Next.js (Vanilla)" starter** - A plain-CSS Next.js template built for the visual editor. The existing starter is now labeled "Next.js (Tailwind)" so the choice is clear.
- **You can style unstyled elements now** - Selecting an element with no class used to dead-end with "can't edit this element's classes in source." Both editors now offer **Add class**, which writes a real class attribute into your source — and refuses with a precise explanation if it can't safely tell which element you mean, rather than ever guessing.
- **Arrow keys step values in the editor** - Click any value field (padding, margin, gap, width, font-size…) and press ↑/↓ to nudge it. Shift jumps ×10, Alt fine-steps. Works in both editors, matching the drag-to-scrub behavior.
- **Editor dropdowns match the app** - Length preset menus no longer use the macOS system popup that ignored the dark theme.
- **Windows: terminals no longer stall at startup** - Windows' ConPTY blocks all terminal output until a cursor-position query is answered; if the app wasn't ready to answer, the terminal sat at "Starting…" forever. The backend now answers whenever no terminal view is attached. Community fix by Vasanth — thank you!
- **Agent connect flows actually sign you in** - The Connect buttons for Claude/Codex now run the real sign-in flows (`claude auth login` / `codex login`) instead of leaving you stranded in the agent's chat prompt.
- **Preview reliability** - Next.js hot-reload no longer goes stale until you re-enter the project, and if an agent kills your dev server the preview now says so honestly — with a Restart button that actually restarts.
- **Import can't crash the app anymore** - Importing a repository with a symlink loop (or other unusual layouts) used to crash Ship Studio outright; every import step now fails gracefully with a specific message.
- **The screen-recording prompt explains itself** - macOS asks for screen-recording permission for project thumbnails; the app now tells you why before the scary system dialog, and respects a "no" instead of re-asking forever.

## What's New in v0.13.4

- **Fixed dragging files into terminals on Retina Macs** - Dropping a file or screenshot into an agent terminal silently did nothing since v0.13.2 (a coordinate-scaling bug in the drop routing). Drops land correctly again — and still go only to the terminal under your cursor.
- **Setup is much harder to break** - Installs and connections now use the same PATH the checklist verifies with (fixes "Node is installed but npm not found" for nvm/volta/fnm users), a missing tool gets an instant plain-English message instead of a dead terminal, one stuck program can no longer freeze the whole setup check, and "finished but didn't actually install" (like an offline Homebrew install) is detected and explained instead of silently ignored.
- **Auth flows stop crying wolf** - After you sign in to GitHub or Claude, the wizard now gives the login a few seconds to register before declaring it failed.
- **Error messages tell you what actually happened** - Errors across the app now show the real underlying failure (with the command and its output) instead of generic "Something went wrong" text. Error notifications stay on screen until you dismiss them and have a Copy button, so you can paste the full error into Slack instead of screenshotting it. Failed command-palette actions now say so — they used to fail silently.

## What's New in v0.13.3

- **Fixed frozen setup and connect terminals** - A v0.13.2 regression froze onboarding, install, and connect terminals after their first moments of output — GitHub/Vercel/agent connections stuck at "Starting…" and installs freezing mid-way (like at the password prompt). They now stream output correctly again. If you got stuck setting up on v0.13.2, update and try again.

## What's New in v0.13.2

- **Terminals no longer get stuck at "Starting…"** - Fixed the root cause: the terminal's first output could be lost in a startup race, making agents look dead (Windows especially, occasionally macOS). Onboarding terminals also auto-retry a wedged start and show a real error instead of hanging forever. Thanks to Sam Cotterill for the community fix.
- **Windows: paste works properly** - Ctrl+V pastes instantly (it could take 30 seconds or never land), and you can now paste a screenshot straight into the agent terminal — it's saved and handed to your agent as a file.
- **Dropping a file lands in one terminal, not all of them** - Dragging a file or image into a terminal no longer types its path into every open agent across all your projects.
- **Windows: full-page screenshots fixed** - Full-page capture silently produced only the visible area; it now works, and if capture ever falls back you'll see a notice instead of nothing.
- **Visual editor dropdowns stay open** - On newer macOS versions, dropdowns in the edit panel could close the instant you opened them.
- **Plugins fail loudly, not silently** - Clicking a plugin that errors now shows the real message, a crashing plugin is disabled for the session instead of being uninstalled from disk, plugin counts are accurate, and the Install button no longer loops after a plugin renames itself.
- **Setup installs show the real error** - Failed installs surface the actual terminal output (not "Command failed. Click to try again"), and Windows now finds Node installed via nvm-windows, fnm, or Volta.
- **Blank preview explains itself** - If your site doesn't render in the preview (for example Clerk development keys causing a redirect loop), you now get an explanation and a suggested fix instead of an empty pane.
- **No more infinite spinner or black window at launch** - Every startup step now times out with a retry option, and if the app can't boot at all you get an actionable screen instead of a black void. Also restored bundle compatibility with macOS 12.
- **Claude sign-in fixes** - An expired login no longer blocks signing back in, and failed sign-ins show what actually went wrong.
- **Windows compatibility pass** - File tree and assets panel no longer collapse, shortcut hints show Ctrl instead of ⌘, project names display correctly, and Android SDK detection works.
- **Clearer errors everywhere** - The last "[object Object]" messages (env editor, project import, project creation) now show real errors.


## What's New in v0.13.1

- **Edit code in the app** - The Code tab now has an Edit toggle for live editing (⌘S to save); read-only mode stays for selecting code to send to your agent. Remembered across projects and sessions.
- **Fixed GitHub import** - Importing a repository no longer fails with a "forbidden path" error — it now clones and imports correctly.
- **Fixed inline text editing** - Double-clicking to edit copy in the preview now writes to source and persists in vanilla-CSS and Astro projects.


## What's New in v0.13.0

- **A rebuilt CSS editor for non-Tailwind projects** - Click any element and see its full cascade as editable cards — like browser devtools, but every change writes straight to your real CSS. Edit every rule that styles the element, in cascade order, with overridden properties shown struck through.
- **Modern CSS, visually** - Add new selectors, nest rules, and scope styles with @media, @container, @supports, @layer and @scope — all live-previewed and saved to source. Works on vanilla CSS and Astro `<style>` blocks.
- **Smart Tab-to-fill** - As you build a rule, press Tab to accept the most likely next declaration (flex companions, the text-truncation trio, transition defaults…) — using your own design tokens when you have them.
- **Variables, animations, and element settings** - Edit your project's CSS custom properties and @keyframes from dedicated panels, and change an element's tag, classes, and attributes from a Settings tab.
- **Remove a project without deleting your files** - Removing a project takes it off the dashboard but leaves everything on disk, so you can re-import it anytime.
- **Git uses the right account per workspace** - Push, pull, fetch, and publish now run as the GitHub account linked to each workspace, so projects on different accounts no longer act as the wrong user.


## What's New in v0.12.0

- **Cursor CLI agent** - Cursor joins Claude Code, Codex, and Opencode as a built-in AI agent. Install it during setup, sign in, run `cursor-agent` in your workspace terminal, and set it as your default agent.
- **Visual editor now works with Vite** - Point-and-click style editing works on Vite + React + Tailwind projects, not just Next.js, Astro, and Shopify.
- **Restart an agent terminal** - If your coding agent exits, restart it right in place instead of opening a new tab.
- **First-run terminal hint** - A fresh agent terminal shows a short hint about what to do, until you start typing.
- **Smoother onboarding** - Clearer setup wizard copy and more accurate tool detection. On Windows, Node.js now installs reliably during setup.
- **Fixes** - A macOS 12 launch crash, GitHub showing as disconnected when a second account had an invalid token, and the Cmd+K "port" search now points to Project settings.


## What's New in v0.11.2

- **Create a branch with unsaved work** - Creating a branch while you have uncommitted changes no longer errors out. You now get a choice: commit them on your current branch first, or stash them aside — then the new branch is created and switched to.
- **Clearer Git errors** - Errors in the Branches tab now show the real message instead of "[object Object]".


## What's New in v0.11.1

- **GitHub connect fix** - Fixed a loop where connecting GitHub would authenticate in the browser (GitHub showed connected) but the button stayed grey and kept re-prompting. Hit Windows users especially, plus some Macs. Your default workspace now finds your existing GitHub login wherever it actually lives.


## What's New in v0.11.0

- **Visual editing for plain CSS projects** - Point-and-click style editing now works on vanilla HTML/CSS and plain Astro sites, not just Tailwind. Select any element and edit its real CSS rule; the change applies to every element that shares the class.
- **Edit by class, state, and breakpoint** - Choose which of an element's classes you're styling, target states like :hover, and edit responsive @media layers, all from the panel.
- **Visual or code** - Flip any rule between the structured controls and a real code editor with syntax highlighting, then save straight back to your stylesheet.
- **New plain HTML/CSS starter** - Spin up a no-framework project in one click.
- **Faster and safer** - Element selection is snappier on large projects, and editing no longer crashes on pages that contain emoji or accented text.


## What's New in v0.10.0

- **Workspaces** - Keep separate Claude, GitHub, and Codex logins for different clients or orgs, fully isolated. Each workspace has its own credentials, so an agent working in one project never sees another's auth. Your existing setup becomes the "Default" workspace, untouched. Assign any project to a workspace — its terminals, git, PRs, and AI all use that workspace's logins automatically — and move projects between workspaces right from the dashboard.
- **Credential vault** - Store a per-workspace Vercel token, Anthropic base URL, and git identity securely in the macOS Keychain. Secret values never leave the backend.
- **Choose your projects folder** - Point Ship Studio at any folder (like an existing ~/Dev directory) instead of ~/ShipStudio, globally or per workspace, and optionally move your existing projects across.
- **Windows fixes** - The Code tab no longer shows a garbled file list, and "Install Claude Code" now installs from the terminal instead of opening a browser. Setup terminals also remind you that a typed password stays hidden even though nothing appears.


## What's New in v0.9.0

- **Custom classes** - A Webflow-style, Tailwind-native class system in the visual editor: create a reusable class from an element's styles, apply or remove classes, and edit a class once to update every element using it.


## What's New in v0.8.2

- **Preview reliability** - Live preview now opens reliably on slow-compiling dev servers (Next.js 16 / Turbopack) instead of getting stuck on "Stopped waiting". **Edit panel scroll** - The pinned visual editor panel now scrolls when its content is tall.


## What's New in v0.8.1

- **Start faster** - An empty dashboard now offers a one-click "Create your first project" instead of a blank screen
- **Organized template gallery** - The create-project picker groups starters into Websites & web apps, Mobile apps, and Other, with a star marking the recommended pick
- **Tidier workspace header** - The branch and your open tabs share a single row, and labels collapse gracefully on narrow windows
- **See your agent working** - A subtle spinning dot on the sidebar project and its tabs shows when an agent is thinking, without watching the terminal
- **Static-site preview** - Plain HTML/JS projects with a package.json can opt into instant static preview, with a one-click "Fix with AI" hand-off if it fails to load
- **Smarter publishing** - Commit messages are auto-written from your actual changes instead of a generic placeholder
- **Stash-aware branch switching** - The toast now tells you when your stashed changes were restored on switch
- **Reliability** - Network commands (git, gh, agents) time out instead of hanging the UI, dev-server port conflicts auto-clear, and PR errors show real messages instead of "[object Object]"


## What's New in v0.8.0

- **Shopify themes** - Build Online Store 2.0 themes: create from the new starter or import any theme repo, connect your store through a guided setup, and preview real Liquid rendered against your actual store with hot reload. Cmd+K commands build sections with AI and push your theme for review; visual edit mode works on .liquid sections
- **Replace images visually** - Select any image in edit mode and swap it from your assets folder; the new path is written straight into source
- **Interactive dev server logs** - Answer CLI prompts (logins, y/n confirms) by clicking the logs and typing; logs auto-follow new output and stay scrollable
- **Wrapped terminal links fixed** - URLs split across lines now highlight and open as one link
- **Import any repo** - GitHub repos without a package.json (Flutter, Rust, plain HTML) no longer fail at the dependency step
- **Security hardening** - Closed path-traversal, command-injection, and IPC trust gaps across backend commands
- **Fixes** - Project rename no longer breaks open-project guards or shows malformed errors


## What's New in v0.7.1

- **Element tree** - Fullscreen edit mode gains a Webflow-style navigator: every element on the page as a collapsible tree. Click to select (the edit panel picks it up instantly), hover to highlight, and selection stays in sync both ways. Toggle it from the toolbar
- **Fullscreen preview** - A new button next to refresh expands the preview to fill the window (Esc exits). Combine with edit mode for a full designer layout: elements | canvas | edit panel
- **Pin the visual editor** - A pin in the Edit panel docks it as a sidebar so it never covers your page. Works in fullscreen too, and the choice sticks across projects
- **Mobile app starters** - The create-project picker now offers Expo, React Native, and Flutter templates, each opening straight into a live device preview
- **Choose your assets folder** - The Assets panel can point anywhere in your project (like src/assets for Astro), per project, from a picker in the breadcrumb bar
- **Clickable terminal links** - URLs printed by dev servers, build logs, and agents now open in your browser
- **Polish** - Double-clicking the device mirror no longer selects the preview, matched toolbar icons, and a distinct full-width breakpoint icon


## What's New in v0.7.0

- **Mobile app previews** - Open a React Native, Expo, or Flutter project and the preview pane becomes a real, interactive device. Ship Studio boots an iOS Simulator or Android emulator, builds and launches your app onto it (build log streams in), and mirrors the screen live — tap, swipe, and type right in the workspace. macOS only for now.
- **Android, no setup required** - Android runs on a low-latency scrcpy stream with the server bundled. Projects targeting both platforms get an iOS | Android picker in the preview toolbar.
- **Set up with AI** - Missing Xcode or the Android SDK? A one-click hand-off sends your agent a detailed install prompt instead of dead-ending you with manual steps.
- **Multilingual sites** - Cmd+K → "Languages" to add languages to any Next.js or Astro site. Search every language, pick a default, and Ship Studio edits your i18n config surgically — it never guesses, and unusual configs fall back to a "Fix with AI" hand-off instead of being overwritten.
- **Translate with AI** - "Save & translate with AI" shows you the exact translation prompt to review, then copies or pastes it straight into your agent terminal. App Router projects get a guided next-intl setup the same way.
- **Preview in any language** - A globe switcher appears in the preview toolbar once you have 2+ languages, and switching pages keeps the language you are viewing. Removing a language warns about leftover translated files and offers an AI cleanup prompt.
- **"Open in Browser" is now "Open"** - Same button, shorter label.


## What's New in v0.6.8

- **Inline text editing in the visual editor** - Double-click any text on the page to rewrite it right there, Webflow-style. Select text to make it bold, italic, or a link, and press Enter for a line break. Works the same on Next.js and Astro, saves to your source, and is free (0 tokens).
- **Dynamic text → agent hand-off** - When text comes from your code or data and can't be edited inline, the panel gives you a one-click "Copy request for your agent" to paste into the terminal.
- **Clearer selection** - The element you're editing is outlined in blue; other same-source elements an edit will also change are outlined in orange.
- **Fix: dev server restart no longer crashes the app** - Restarting the dev server was killing Ship Studio's own preview (WebKit) process on some setups.
- **Dev server wait screen is no longer a black box** - Stop waiting instantly, read live dev-server logs inline, or hand the stuck server to your agent with "Fix with agent".
- **Fix: branch cleanup after merge** - Merged branches now delete correctly even when GitHub auto-deletes the head branch.


## What's New in v0.6.7

- **Visual editor works on Astro + Tailwind** - Edit pages built with custom CSS classes too; edits win the cascade and save to your .astro source. The editor only appears when Tailwind is actually set up in the project
- **Smoother Astro editing** - Saving no longer snaps the preview back to the top of the page
- **Clearer editor** - An intro explains what it does before you select anything (Next.js/Astro + Tailwind, free, 0 tokens, live + instant saves)
- **Support button opens Slack** - The toolbar Support button now opens the Ship Studio community Slack directly


## What's New in v0.6.6

- **Responsive breakpoint editing** - Edit Tailwind classes per breakpoint in the visual editor; the preview canvas resizes to match and edits preview truthfully across widths
- **Many more controls + Custom CSS** - Collapsible sections covering size, layout, typography, borders, and effects, plus a custom box that turns any `property: value` into a real Tailwind arbitrary-property class
- **Astro support** - The visual editor now works on Astro + Tailwind sites, not just Next.js/React
- **Free-form values, floating Reset & shared-component scope** - Type exact lengths in any field, reset a value from a floating button at your cursor, and see where a shared component is used with click-through to the source
- **Auto-save toggle & hidden preview scrollbars**


## What's New in v0.6.5

- **Visual editor (Beta)** - Toggle "Edit (Beta)" in the preview to click any element and fine-tune its Tailwind classes visually — padding/margin (drag-to-scrub box model), gap, alignment, size, weight, radius, display, flex, border, and opacity — with instant live preview and one-click Save to source.
- **Color picker** - Edit text/background colors with a HEX/RGB/HSL/OKLCH picker and opacity slider; edits keep the element's existing color format (OKLCH stays OKLCH).


## What's New in v0.6.4

- **Monorepo support** — Ship Studio now detects pnpm/npm workspaces when you import a repo (or first open an existing project) and asks which app you want to work on. The dev server, preview, and `/public` asset tools all run inside that workspace, while git and PRs stay at the repo root. Choose "Use the whole repo" to skip the picker.
- **Merge right after submitting for review** — After you create a PR, the Submit for Review window stays open with an inline "Merge into main" action. If there are conflicts you can hand them to the agent ("Ask agent to fix") or resolve them yourself, and once it's merged you get a one-click branch-cleanup prompt.
- **One-click dependency install** — Open a project whose `node_modules` is missing and the preview pane shows an "Install with pnpm" prompt instead of a blank screen. Click it to stream the install in a terminal; the dev server starts automatically when it finishes.
- **Fixes** — Removing and re-adding a local folder now re-prompts the workspace picker, and fixed a bug where the dependency-install terminal could relaunch itself every couple of seconds.


## What's New in v0.6.3

- **Side-by-side agents** — in focus mode with two or more agents on a project, toggle "Split" in the terminal toolbar to view them side by side. Drag the handle between panes to resize. Click a pane to make it the active one.
- **Open in Browser** now opens your real dev server URL (e.g. `localhost:3000`) instead of Ship Studio's internal proxy port.
- **Auto-accept on resume** — resumed sessions now apply auto-accept mode correctly on startup; a race could previously cause it to silently turn off.
- **Sync dropdown polish** — no longer shows the stale "All changes synced — Done" view after dismissing it without clicking Done.
- **Agent Settings dropdown** stays on-screen in focus mode (previously cut off on the right).
- **Modal headers** — Skills, MCP, Help, and Project Settings modals no longer have their first row of content touching the header border.


## What's New in v0.6.2

- **Undo/Redo (⌘Z / ⌘⇧Z)** — every burst of edits gets snapshotted as a git stash so you can roll the working tree back, even on changes the agent never committed. Toast confirms "Undid 3 files: App.tsx, Preview.tsx +1 more". Buttons grey out at the edge of history. Native character-undo still wins inside text inputs.
- **Custom project thumbnails** — upload your own thumbnail via the project menu; auto-capture stops overwriting it.
- **Sidebar agent picker** — replaced the hover-to-open behaviour with an explicit caret button next to "Add new agent" so the agent name no longer shifts when the cursor drifts past.
- **Skip broken Claude binaries** — if a stale `claude` install is on the GUI PATH (e.g. an old `/opt/homebrew/bin/claude` from a legacy installer), Ship Studio now validates each candidate with `--version` and falls through to the next working install instead of surfacing the raw npm-wrapper error.


## What's New in v0.6.1

- **Health tab in the Inspect panel** — Code Health moved into the Inspect panel with a tab-native layout: status rows for Test / Lint / Types / Format and inline output for the selected check.
- **Open in Browser button** — Preview toolbar now has an "Open in Browser" button next to the breakpoint icons. Click to open the default browser, hover to pick a specific one (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Arc, Brave, Edge).
- **Dev server row shows the port** — Sidebar "Dev server" row now shows `localhost:3001` inline instead of a separate "running" badge.
- **Security hardening** — CI now scans high-trust config files (eslint, vite, package.json, workflows) for obfuscated-payload signatures and runs with a read-only GITHUB_TOKEN scope by default.


## What's New in v0.6.0

- **Cmd+K command palette** — Press ⌘K anywhere to switch projects, open modals, or run actions. Cmd+1..9 jumps to pinned projects. The workspace header is slimmer because IDE picker, env editor, backups, plugin manager, and Learn Mode toggle all live in the palette now.
- **Inspect panel** — New collapsible panel under the preview with **Server Logs** (dev server output) and **Browser Tools** (Console, Network, Elements from the live preview). Each tab has a "Send to agent" button so you can pipe runtime errors, network requests, or DOM trees straight into your coding agent.
- **Focus tab** — New workspace tab between Preview and Code that hides the preview pane and gives the agent terminal the full workspace — for when you're running your own browser alongside.
- **Send-to-agent everywhere** — Server logs, code snippets, console/network entries, DOM trees, and even the live viewport dimensions all have buttons or drag-to-select that pipe context into the active agent's prompt.
- **Resizable preview** — Drag the right or bottom edge of the preview to resize freely. The iframe centers and frames as a floating panel when both dimensions are custom. "Full" breakpoint resets back to fill.
- **Compact mode rebuild** — Narrow windows (under 750px) now use a purpose-built layout — terminal plus agent/project switcher and an always-on-top pin in the topbar — instead of squeezing the full workspace down. Open-in-browser dropdown moved to the sidebar Dev server row.
- **Header overhaul** — Agent Settings and Plugins each have a proper labeled dropdown. Plugins dropdown now actually opens non-hosting plugins (Webflow, Figma, etc.) instead of just dumping you into the Plugin Manager. Restart-dev-server moved into the sidebar.
- **Sidebar refinements** — Add-new-agent footer, hover-opens-picker on the agent "+" button, click the Dev server row to jump straight to Inspect → Server Logs, and you can finally collapse the current project with its chevron.
- **Underlined workspace tabs** — Preview / Code / Branches / PRs and the breakpoint controls switched from button-style backgrounds to a cleaner underline treatment.
- **Live W × H readout** — Preview toolbar shows the iframe's current pixel dimensions; click it to send the size to your agent.
- **Security fix** — HTML in page text and attributes is now escaped before being sent to the agent.


## What's New in v0.5.1

- **Fixed garbled terminal output on some macOS betas** — new "Terminal GPU acceleration" toggle in Settings → Preferences lets you fall back to the canvas renderer if agent output looks fragmented or corrupted


## What's New in v0.5.0

- **Multi-project multitasking** — Run multiple projects at once with live Claude Code / Codex / Opencode sessions and dev servers in each. Switching projects is instant — nothing tears down until you explicitly close it.
- **Sidebar overhaul** — Pinned and active project groups, attention indicators when a background terminal needs your input, searchable "+" picker to pin any project, drag-to-reorder, and proper scroll behavior.
- **External dev-server death detection** — Sidebar status flips immediately if Next.js crashes or the port is killed from elsewhere; no more stale "running" indicators.
- **Opencode agent** — Third coding agent option alongside Claude Code and Codex, managed from a new Coding Agents panel on the dashboard with install / sign-in / set-default controls.
- **Dashboard redesign** — Coding Agents, Preferences, and Integrations live in matching cards for a cleaner stack. "What's New" is a modal now, not an inline sidebar.
- **Workspace toolbar split** — Sidebar toggle stays up top; Restart dev server and project settings moved to the lower toolbar for tighter grouping.
- **Plugin crash isolation** — A misbehaving plugin can no longer take down the whole app. Plugins that crash are auto-removed with a toast so you can keep working.
- **Backups on non-git projects** — Safe backup restore now works on folders without git history.
- **Error monitoring** — Frontend and backend errors are now reported to Sentry so hangs and crashes get diagnosed faster.
- **Stability fixes** — No more dropped async results under React StrictMode, `--no-pager` on git subprocess calls (was hanging on large repos), and better error discrimination on the frontend.
